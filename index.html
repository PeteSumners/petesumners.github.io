    <h1>GetFastData</h1>
    <h2>Guided by God, Rooted in Peace</h2>
    <p>
      We build our own tools—every scraper, parser, filter, and signal processor—crafted from first principles.
      No plug-ins. No black boxes. No shortcuts. Just clarity, control, and care.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is our OSINT stack: clean, minimal, and sovereign. Tailored to those who refuse to borrow
      someone else's eyes. We gather only what’s needed, and nothing we don’t understand.
    </p>

    <p>
      This isn’t about surveillance. It’s about stewardship.
      Not about watching the world burn, but reading the wind before the fire starts.
    </p>

    <p>
      The aim isn’t noise. It’s signal. So we build with intent—from raw packet capture
      to contextual truth. Our pipeline is lean, legible, and righteous.
    </p>

    <div class="verse">
      "He has shown you, O man, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you
      but to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?" – Micah 6:8
    </div>

    <p>
      We’ll guide you in the art of digital discernment. From packet to pattern, from headline to heartbeat.
      Learn to build your own crawlers. Train your own models. Trust your own eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’re not escaping the world—we’re seeing it more clearly. To feed the orphan,
      protect the widow, and defend the good when the fog rolls in.
    </p>

    <p>
      This isn’t about becoming kings. It's about ceasing to be slaves.
      A peasant with code, land, and clear sight is freer than a prince who lives blind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everything good was made through Christ—and we aim to live like we believe that.
    </p>
