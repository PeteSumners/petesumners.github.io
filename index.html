    <h2>Guided by God, Rooted in Peace</h2>
    <p>
      We’re not here to game the system. We’re here to plant, to tend, to learn to live again—
      in harmony with the Creator. Not as wolves among wolves, but as sheep who know the voice
      of their Shepherd.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a place to find tools, knowledge, and wisdom—not for power, but for provision.
      To feed the orphan, protect the widow, and rest in the shade of righteousness.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’re not optimizing for violence or dominance. If we need to fight, we've already lost.
      Instead, we build with care, steward what we’re given, and wait on the Lord.
    </p>

    <p>
      This isn’t about becoming kings. It's about ceasing to be slaves.
      A peasant with land, family, and peace is freer than a prince who fears tomorrow.
    </p>

    <div class="verse">
      "He has shown you, O man, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you
      but to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?" – Micah 6:8
    </div>

    <p>
      We’ll guide you toward simple, resilient living: land, sleep, health, stillness.
      We'll teach you how to see, how to listen, how to gather truth with clean hands and a clear heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not because it's clever. But because it's right.
      Everything good was made through Christ—and we aim to live like we believe that.
    </p>
